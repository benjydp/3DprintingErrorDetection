# 3DprintingErrorDetection
3D printing error detection proof of concept with CNN

1. Download the entire project
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (errorDetection.ipynb)
3. Run the two first blocks "Imports" and "Loading the dataset"
4. Each model has three blocks to run. Initialization, Fitting and Graph creation
5. Choose which model to use, and run it's three corresponding code blocks.
6. The final model has an additional block for evaluation, using the test data.
